## :hammer_and_wrench: Pre-Assignment

### Updating our repository with Week 2 content

If you have not finished setup from Week 1, follow the steps 1 to 11.

If you have finished the setup, go directly to step 12.

<details>
  <summary>Creating your repository</summary>
  <br>

1. The first thing to do is create a new empty public repository!

2. Be sure to fill out your repository name, description, and ensure it's public! NOTE: DO NOT ADD A README OR LICENSE

3. Now that you've done the required set-up on GitHub.com, let's move to our terminal and clone the MLE-10 repository!
     
     ```console
     git clone git@github.com:FourthBrain/MLE-10.git
     ```   

4. Now, we're going to copy the contents of the assignment to a new folder using the following command
     
     ```console
     cp -r MLE-8/assignments/week-2-analyze-sentiment-twitter .
     ```

5. Once that is complete, we'll `cd` into the newly created folder with
     
     ```console
     cd week-2-analyze-sentiment-twitter
     ```
     
6. Now, let's init our repository in this folder using
     
     ```console
     git init
     ```
     
7. We'll add the contents of the folder using
     
     ```console
     git add .
     ```
     
8. Let's create an initial commit!
     
     ```console
     git commit -m "Initial Commit"
     ```
     
9. Now we can add our created repository as a remote using the following command. Don't forget, you can get the SSH address from your repository by clicking the green `Code` button on GitHub.com!
     
     ```console
     git remote add main git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/<YOUR REPOSITORY NAME>
     ```
     
10. Now we'll set our branch to `main`
     
     ```console
     git branch -M main
     ```
     
11. Last, but not least, let's push the contents of our commit to our repo!
     
     ```console
     git push -u main main
     ```

12. OPTIONAL: If you've already cloned the MLE-8 repository - feel free to pull the recent changes by `cd`ing into the directory that contains the MLE-8 repo, and running this command. Be sure to return to the parent directory before moving on! (`cd ..`)
     
     ```console
      git pull origin main
     ```

13. That's it, that's all!

### Setting up your environment üêçüñ•Ô∏è

Create a new Conda environment for sentiment anaylsis (sa)

```console
  conda create -n sa python=3.8 jupyter -y
```

Activate your new environment

  conda activate sa
```

Open the jupyter-notebook
