# 🛍️ Launch New Products 

Today you are a machine learning engineer at the Department of New Products at Target Cosmetics! 

We will start with a small dataset on interactions between users and current products from the past and try to discover substructure, if there's any, by applying some **unsupervised learning** methods. 

Then we will leverage the small amount of labeled data (current products) in combination with a larger amount of unlabeled data (new products to launch) to make estimations as to which products with sell more. 

# 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- apply dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce features to a lower dimensional space
- perform customer segmentation, determine optional number of clusters, and understand assumptions for used algorithm
- understand what semi-supervised learning is and leverage it to improve performance of supervised learning

# 📝 Note.
In this session, not all the imports are provided; for `YOUR CODE HERE`, you may need to import necessary modules / functions to be able to run the code successfully.

# 🛠️ Pre-work
For this session, the following dependencies will be needed
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You have encountered these packages already in previous sessions; not necessary to re-install them.

## Background
Please review the weekly narrative [here](https://www.notion.so/Week-8-Unsupervised-Semi-Supervised-and-Self-Supervised-Learning-cfdce4c11b894966b71a3cb3963141f0)
