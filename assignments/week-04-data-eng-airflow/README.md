# <h1 align="center" id="heading">EDA with Walmart Sales</h1>

## Business Objective

Walmart, the retail giant that operates a chain of hypermarkets, wants to understand their weekly sales data, especially the impact from holidays and or big events on the weekly sales data; specifically, Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. In addition, Walmart wants to consider the effect from different macroeconomic/external factors. 

##  ☑️ Learning Objectives
At the end of this session, you will know how to

1. Manipulate data of different types using `pandas`
1. Visualize data with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to Extract insights 
1. Build a pipeline to preprocess data and fit a simple model using `sklearn`

*Note: if you see code that's unfamiliar to you, look up for the documentation, and try to understand what it does.*

## :hammer_and_wrench: Pre-Work
1. activate your `conda` environment; replace `py39_12` with the name of your `conda` environment (`conda env list` to see all available environments)
    ```
    conda activate py39_12
    ```
2. install the required packages under the current directory: `{Your Local Directory}/MLE-10/assignments/eda-walmart-sales/`
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Launch jupyter notebook or jupyter lab
    ```
    jupyter notebook # or jupyter lab
    ```
4. Run notebook [imports](prework/imports.ipynb) and make sure no error messages are displayed when importing the packages.
